I have not been a fan of what EA has done with the Star Wars franchise, but i would Hi Guys I'm either tripping or just not happy with the answer I've come to. I remember playing a Star Wars RTS game. The first one that came to mind was Empire At War but when I got the game back on GOG it looked outdated and not exactly what I remember. So it had the same planetary / galaxy interface as Empire At War however it seemed a lot more polished (looked nicer). I remember the Emperor being in it, and one distinct memory is that it had a massive glitch / bug which a lot of people. Just a dream really but I was wondering what you guys thought - if EA were to get the Command amp Conquer team to make a new Star Wars RTS, would you be hyped? I know the people who made Empire at War are all gone from that team but I think it might still be a pretty decent. The last true Star Wars based Real Time Stratagy game released was Empire at War (with its Forces of Corruption Expansion). Before Empire at War, there were a couple other Star wars themed RTS games like Galactic Battlegrounds saga, Rebellion, and Force Commander. Though all of these games are quite aged by now, with the least old star wars rts game Empire at war being roughly 9 years old. Empire at War though does have great modpacks that were released for it; with some like Republic 
Is there any star wars game or mod of a game that has really good space combat, and that operates kind of like Empire at war where you move fleets around to capture planets and when you hit a contested one it drops you down into an rts type game. sorry if that's too specific, thanks in advance. Just wondering if anyone knows about even a slight rumor about a Star Wars RTS like Empire at War or are the 1st/3rd person games (titles) expected. Other than RaW and older. I get really into the game and feel like I get really boring or quiet, is my commentary suffering due to the game type and subject matter or is that just me? https://youtu.be/LsmOM0XwFTM. This might get buried in Rogue One discussion, but Starcraft is my favourite game of all time and I can't help but think the star wars universe would make for a great RTS game. Unfortunately the rts genre has declined in popularity recently but does anyone think this would be a good idea? EDIT: I specifically mean competitive multiplayer. Join me as I prepare to start a large military campaign in space and on land! Gonna invade me some planets y'all! The Galactic Republic is going to win this war! https://youtu.be/LsmOM0XwFTM. 
really have the hankering for some star wars rts! I was reading up on some and just curious if any know any good ones/mods for current games. Platform: PC Genre: Real-Time Strategy Estimated year of release: 2006 or earlier Graphics/art style:- Notable characters: Darth Vater Notable gameplay mechanics: Similar to Age of Empire 2/3 Other details: I don't remember much about the game, it's all blurry, all I remember is always hopping on it after school, ah good days. the starting icon had Darth Vader's face on it, and the main menu was Darth Vader inside the pod of some kind of crashed spaceship. You could type that's no moon and a Death Star would </p>
