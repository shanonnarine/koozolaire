                            <p> Lego Digital Designer ( is required to use the LDD files/instructions. Unfortunately Megatron does not transform accurately. G1 Megatron pics ( instructions ( G1 Optimus Prime pics ( instructions ( G1 Soundwave pics ( instructions (http://www.mo. I'm trying to use LDD ( on a Mac and, as soon as it opens, I get a "cannot connect to the Internet" error. I've tried it on multiple Macs, to the same result. I don't get the error on PC installs. Is their build for Mac broken. Note: If you have Lego Worlds compatible LDD files, please comment below with a screenshot and a link to the LXFML file download to add to the directory! Hi guys. As you know, we can import LDD models directly into Lego Worlds! The only issue we face is that only bricks found within Lego Worlds can be imported into the game. Currently, if you import a model that uses non-supported bricks, they do not appear in game. This thread will act as a directory of Lego Worlds compatible LDD files. ##Hello /r/LEGO! The mods of our community have officially put me in charge of organizing and implementing our flair system! What is flair? Flair are icons that you can put next to your name and links in this subreddit, which let everybody know something about you and LEGO. For instance, if you are a huge Castle fan, you can put a castle icon next to your name to let others know! We need your help to ensure this list is thorough , but concise , by contributing your own ideas. If you don't know what I'm talking about check this out: I know this is basically what minecraft is, but still, it'd be pretty. Howdy folks, here's the new contest. It's "prehistoric" themed! ###Rules: 1. No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. 2. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts, but it must be at least ~70% Bionicle/Technic. 3. Entries to the contest must be made for the contest, no MOCs you've made previously. They must all be new. 4. One entry per user. You can't switch, modify, or change your entry after you have already submitted 
This month's contest theme is Rahi or otherwise non-humanoid MOCs. ###Rules: No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts, but it must be at least ~70% Bionicle/Technic. Entries to the contest must be made for the contest, no MOCs you've made previously. They must all be new. One entry per user. You can't switch, modify, or change your entry after you have already submitted Hey guys, just curious how many people here us LDD (LEGO Digital Designer) to plan out Mocs before hand? Is it worth my time? Or is it better to just start placing bricks and see where Howdy folks! The previous winner did not reply to any queries as to what they wanted this contest's theme to be, so I and the other mods of the Discord decided on weapons! Anything from bladed weapons to guns to wizard staffs are allowed. ###Rules: Special Rule 1 This contest is about the weapon. You do not need to include a MOC wielding the weapon, but it is allowed. The wielder may be a previously built MOC, or even built for this contest. Please have pictures including a wielder. 
Howdy folks! The new contest theme is Mechas and/or Exosuits! Basically, anything that has a character go inside it with a significant portion not visible from the outside. It shall be recommended but not required that you use a minifig as the pilot should you build a mecha, but you're more than welcome to make something giant. ###Rules: No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts Howdy folks, got a new contest up. Sorry it's been a while. This contests's theme is were-creatures. Something like a werewolf, or even a were-sheep. A fluffy were-sheep. ###Rules: No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts, but it must be at least ~70% Bionicle/Technic. Entries to the contest must be made for the contest, no MOCs you've made previously. They must all be new. One entry Hey, I've digitally built and rendered my lego rendition of most of the characters in HotS! Album ( I used LDD (Lego Digital Designer) to build them, then used LDD-to-POVRay converter with pov-ray to convert and render them. Edit: Some replies to questions/comments below: But why is Sonya flying? - Because the program I use to render can't let things clip through the floor. er. oooAAUUGHHH! With way too much time on your hands, but still. - I've been workin. It might seem childish, but I'm looking for a professional CAD software that can break down 3D builds into step-by-step instructions like LDD (LEGO Digital Designer). I'd consider it to be a very useful feature to have. If I've thought of it, it must exist somewhere. Hello! As /u/gadgetron94 has decreed, we shall do a Dark Hunters themed contest! For some of you who have been around here for a while, you may recognize the them. We have done this theme before, but I'm told it hasn't been done in at least a year. I don't think I've been the host of one, so possibly even more like 2 years. There are some stipulations to this theme. To quote Gadgetron, " The special requirement would be that you have a clear idea of how your MOC hunts and convey it through. As /u/explosivetortuga has decided, this new contest will be a theme mashup! For example: Space cowboy(sci-fi/western) Sorcerer Pirate(fantasy/pirate) The contest is not limited to these two combinations. Those are the examples Tortuga thought of, and I can't think of any others. #Rules: No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts, but it must be at least ~70% Bionicle/Technic. Entries This month's theme is Medieval Knights! Just. Medieval knights. ~~No special rules this time.~~ Custom cut cloth for capes is allowed. Only capes or cape-like clothing. ###Rules: No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts, but it must be at least ~70% Bionicle/Technic. Entries to the contest must be made for the contest, no MOCs you've made previously. They must all be new. One entry This month's contest will be feudal/medieval Japan themed! Anything from a samurai to a mythological creature is allowed. Want to make an umbrella monster with one leg? Go for it! I have some news relating to this contest, as I've had some questions. The contest entry period is roughly one month. Voting is roughly one week. I will start the new contest after I have posted the results for the previous contest The winner has told me what they want the next contest's theme. The theme for this context is Armor. To quote Innodence, "Create a humanoid knight. The catch is that it must have armor that is fully removable without compromising structural integrity. CCBS may be used as attachment points, but just using a standard CCBS skeleton for the whole thing is less than ideal. I'm going to add a minor caveat. The MOC must look good both with and without the armor. As Innodence said, using just a CCBS skeleton isn't really that great. ###Rules: No painted 
Finally have some free time. I fell in love with LDD (Lego Digital Designer) again, and thought about building some "classic" car with it. Preferably something from the 90's. Can anyone give me some ideas? Only one I could think of was Golf. I hope to build a car with ~600-900 pieces and will be posting rendered photos First: About the project Legoland parks around the world all have a "Miniland" section where famous buildings and locations are recreated ( with Lego at a scale of roughly 1:20. My favourite part are the people, ( which are made of so few bricks yet can portray just about anybody, doing just about anything. As mentioned above, I am taking over for /u/SuperHole. Hopefully he will collaborate my story. Anyways, as /u/acerpacer has decreed, our contest for this month is(drumroll please) A MOC based on a song! So like, I could pick this song, (https://soundcloud.com/hocuspocusofficiel/smile-feat-omar-2) and make a giant smiley face MOC. #Rules No painted, cut, or otherwise modified parts, and no non-LEGO parts. Your creation may have system (bricks, plates, etc) parts
